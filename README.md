A simple database system written in bash

New databases are initialized with `create.sh`.

`insert_record.sh` and `delete_record.sh` are used to insert and delete rows,
respectively.

The DB can be printed with `print_db.sh`. The database is output as a Latex
table, compiled to a PDF, and displayed using Okular.
